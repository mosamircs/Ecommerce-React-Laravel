	- first i install xampp from (apachefriends website)
		1 - download xampp from the apachefriends website 
		2 - run it from terminal - sudo ./xampp_installation_file_and_path
		3 - goto /opt/lampp run sudo  ./manager-linux-x64.run

1-Install composer like so: (from stackoverflow solution) 
	- sudo curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | /opt/lampp/bin/php
2-After installation, you should then symlink it by running command:

	- sudo ln -s /opt/lampp/bin/php /usr/local/bin/php
3-Then run the command below to allow the 'composer' command to be run globally (this will be run from within the folder where you've just installed composer in which a composer.phar file has just been created):

	- sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

you can test from terminal that it's work :
	- php -v
	- composer -v

you will face problem with permissions with htdocs folder this command can help
	-sudo chmod 777 /opt/lampp/htdocs

install laravel 
	- composer global require laravel/installer
	laravel will not work directly you have to add  it to path by this 
		-export PATH="$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH" from this link
